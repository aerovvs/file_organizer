# file_organizer
This is a file organizing script using Python.

Using the source directory for wherever your downloaded files go to, it automates organizing each file to their corresponding folder using each extension type. If you do not have those folders, it creates them for you, and then organizes it correctly. After finishing the organization, the program exits and tells you the automation has been completed.
